- **Withdraw**: Withdraw money from the account.
- **File Update**: Save user balance to a file.

## Requirements

- C compiler (e.g., GCC)

   ```

2. **Compile**

   To compile the code, run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

   ```bash
   gcc -o ATM ATM.c
   ```

   Here, `ATM.c` should be the name of your source file, and `ATM` is the name of the executable file that will be created.
